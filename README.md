I just created a GitHub account, even if I am not familiar with the platform the sing in process was clear and easy.
After log in to my GitHub account I created my first repository on GitHub website, Then downloaded GitHub desktop and installed it in my computer, Then I went back to the GitHub website and in the top left corner of the screen i choose the + icon then select "clone a repository" and now I am adding those information to the readme file on my computer.
